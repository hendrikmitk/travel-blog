## Project: Travel Blog

This project is part of the curriculum of the Full-Stack Web Development program at [Hamburg Coding School](https://hamburgcodingschool.com/).

### Goal

Goal is to publish a Travel Blog where you display a map and markers with posts about the places you visited.

### Features

#### World Map with Google Maps API

-   ~~Use the Google Maps JavaScript API to display a world map.~~
-   ~~For each blog post, put a marker on the map at the location of the post.~~
-   ~~Add a menu bar with title (e.g. "Travel Blog") on the left and author (profile picture, name) on the right.~~

#### Display Blog Posts at Location

-   ~~Make the markers clickable: on click, show the blog post at that location as InfoWindow.~~
-   ~~A blog post should contain:~~
    -   ~~image~~
    -   ~~title~~
    -   ~~text~~
    -   ~~author with name and image~~
    -   ~~date~~
    -   ~~location with city and country~~

#### Get Blog Posts from Firestore

-   ~~Store the blog posts on Firebase Firestore and load them with the Firebase JavaScript API.~~
-   ~~Also save the coordinates of a location with latitude and longitude.~~
-   ~~Load the blog posts as soon as the map is loaded (inside the `initMap()` function).~~
-   ~~Save Markers and InfoWindows in global arrays to handle click events easier.~~

#### Admin View

-   ~~Put a link on the menu bar: "ADMIN".~~
-   ~~This should go to an HTML file `admin.html`.~~
-   ~~This contains the list of blog posts (as in Micro Blog).~~
-   ~~At the bottom, create a form to submit a new blog post.~~
-   ~~On submit, send the new blog post to Firestore.~~
-   ~~For the images, save the image in your project manually and save the relative path as string, e.g. `"img/barcelona.jpg"`.~~

#### Authentication

-   ~~Use Firebase Auth (login with email and password) for authentication.~~
-   ~~If the user is not logged in:~~
    -   ~~they can still see the map with all blog posts~~
    -   ~~they do not see an author in the menu bar~~
    -   ~~they do not see the "ADMIN" link in the menu bar~~
    -   ~~they see a "LOGIN" link in the menu bar~~
-   ~~The "LOGIN" link in the menu bar leads to a page `login.html` that displays a login form.~~
-   ~~Unsuccessful login attempts show a general error message "Username and password do not match."~~
-   ~~If the user successfully logged in:~~
    -   ~~they are sent to the world map~~
    -   ~~they do not see the "LOGIN" link in the menu bar~~
    -   ~~they see the author (profile image, name) in the menu bar~~
    -   ~~they see the "ADMIN" link in the menu bar~~
    -   ~~they see a "Logout" button in the menu bar behind the author~~
-   ~~If the user is not logged in and accesses `admin.html` directly in the browser, they are automatically sent to the login form.~~

#### Imprint / Contact

-   ~~Create a link in the menu bar "CONTACT".~~
-   ~~Create a `contact.html` file.~~ _Created a modal constructed with template literals instead._
-   ~~Put your (and your team mate's) name there.~~
-   ~~Write 2 sentences about your project.~~
-   ~~Put your (or if you prefer [Hamburg Coding School's](https://hamburgcodingschool.com/contact/)) contact details:~~
    -   ~~name~~
    -   ~~address~~
    -   ~~email~~
    -   ~~phone number~~
-   ~~Write a note that this was a project from a course at Hamburg Coding School.~~

#### Tailwind CSS

-   ~~Apply Tailwind CSS to the pages where you haven't already used it.~~
-   ~~Make it pretty.~~ ðŸ¤©

### Optional Bonus Tasks

#### Bonus: Firebase Storage for images

-   ~~Include the Storage API from Firebase.~~
-   ~~Research how to upload and download pictures with Firebase Storage.~~
-   ~~Upload your blog post's images to Storage.~~
-   Load the images from Storage when displaying the blog posts. _WIP_
-   In the form for creating a new blog post, add an option to upload an image for the blog post to Storage.

#### Bonus: Save Author Profile in User object

-   Research how Firebase Auth is connecting user information to a login, and how the User object looks like.
-   Use the User object from Firebase Auth to store profile picture and name.
-   Use this user information as author data wherever you display the author.

#### Bonus: Edit Blog Posts

-   In the Admin view, add an "edit" icon to every blog post.
-   If the user clicks that, the blog post is replaced with a form similar to the one for creating a new blog post.
-   The values of the form are pre-filled with the data from the blog post.
-   Research how changing a blog post works with the Firestore API.
-   On click on the submit button, the old blog post is changed with the new values and sent to Firestore.

#### Bonus: Limit Blog Post Text to 120 Characters

-   ~~Research how you can use JavaScript to limit the number of characters the user can type into a textarea, similar to Twitter.~~
-   ~~For the blog post form, apply that to the textarea for the text.~~
-   ~~Display a number below the textarea that indicates the number of characters, e.g.: `87/120` or `34 left`.~~
-   ~~If the number of characters the user typed in is more than 120:~~
    -   ~~the number turns red~~
    -   ~~the submit button is disabled.~~
-   ~~If the user reduces the number of characters to less than 120:~~
    -   ~~the number is grey/black again~~
    -   ~~the submit button is enabled again.~~
